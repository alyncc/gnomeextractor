# Gnomoria #

## Description: ##

It’s a save game viewer and editor for the Gnomoria game. The philosophy of the program is **making the ingame management easier** by providing the convenient interface. The program is created under the inspiration of the [Dwarf Therapist](http://code.google.com/p/dwarftherapist/). Also it is an **educational project** for the authors, which means its functionality will be chosen considering improvement in our knowledge in programming. Don’t be surprised by  heavy visual interface and other things. Also this means that the development will take **place in the presence of free time** and good mood.
